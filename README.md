## How it works?
1.Aurora is done with Google Collaboratory and tensorflow model using python to classify chakka and mangaa. 
2.First we have Uploaded Keras model , Fruit image 01 and Fruit image 02 to identify the fruit using the given code and the model
3.We run the code with fruit 01 image in jpg format and we get it as mango 
4.Next we run code with fruit 02 image in jpg format and e get it as jackfruit
5.Therefore we have Successfully Completed Chakka Manga Classifier Machine learning Project
## Libraries used
1. Tensorflow Keras
2. HDF5
3. Python
## How to configure
We have Uploaded a keras model , mango fruit as fruit 01.jpg and jackfruit as fruit 02 jpg to Google Collaboratory 
## How to run
1. We have Uploaded Two fruit image and model and in our program we will Locate the fruit image 
2. Fruit 01 is Executed as Mango
3. Fruit 02 is Executed as Jackfruit
4. This program is Executived as per code and Its Compiled Successfully to Classify Chakka and Manga
